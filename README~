Project description: FINAL PROJECT!!!!

TO BEAT THE GAME:

Retrieve the item at the far right end of the level and bring it back to the starting location.
Don't die.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
NEW FEATURES:

*Collision map generated from foreground.  Player successfully runs along the ground and is pulled down by gravity while in the air.  Player can jump, although it doesn't work when he is running downhill because of the way gravity and foot support works.

*Game world is 4x larger than before (6400 px).  Unique art for all 5 layers for entire length. Viewport code modified so that smaller images may be used for the background since the background moves slower.

*new AggroSprite class.  Inherits from MultiSprite.  AI implementation. Some enemies spawn at pre-determined locations.  If the user gets within their aggro range, they will follow the user until they reach their leash length, at which point they will return to their home spot (if the user is also out of range). Uses observer pattern.

*New EffectSprite Class.  Inherits from MultiSprite. Contains a reference to a "host" drawable as well as offset variables so that different effects can be drawn around the host sprite.  Used on the player and the collection item.

*New CollectibleSprite Class.  Inherits MultiSprite.  Added behavior to react and be "collected" when the user comes into contact with it.

*Player Health.  ENEMIES DO DAMAGE AS THEY CONTACT THE PLAYER

*Press r to reset the game.  Resets player and victory item positions.

Comments:
I'm pretty happy with this.  I implemented everything I wanted to, and any changes are minor (like fixing jumping, but jumping isn't essential anyways).  I hope you enjoy it.
