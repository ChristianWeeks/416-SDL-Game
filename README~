Project description: Parallex, HUD, Player Implementations

The Specs that I implemented are:
*new player sprites and PlayerSprite class.  PLAYER MOVES WITH UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, not WSAD
*Toggleable HUD with F1
*Parallex scrolling with 5 layers, uses painter's algorithm
*added new function to FrameFactory class to produce a multilayered background



The Specs that I was unable to implement are:
*Did not implement a new XML parser

Things I wanted to do (and will inevitably do, but just weren't required for the project):
*fix player sprite so that it does not automatically reverse velocity when hitting a wall
*fix key captures so they are less clunky
*fix the spinning demon's sprite... It looks better but the image is off by a pixel, causing it to shift slightly and wrap around.  It's difficult to create
sprites that are accurate up to a single pixel!
*lower the ground so the sky is more visible
*make longer and more detailed backgrounds

Extras:
*changed multisprite so that sprite velocities were randomly generated rather than pulled from XML.  I got tired of watching the same path over and over again.
*all sprites + background made by me!
*modified the spinning demon's sprite to have a more smooth animation


What I want to Implement:

By the end of this course I'd like for my game to be a simple side-scroller, where the user has to explore a dark and foreboding world,
and collect some sort of item while avoiding the frightening demons.  More than anything I want it to be an emotionally captivating experience,
so I'm not sure if I want to provide the user with a means to kill or dispatch the demons.  I'd like to have unique and smooth animations for
all of the characters and animations for the player that include jumping, running, picking up an item, etc.  The game will be a linear level,
so it will end when the character reaches the far right of the world.  Score can be determined by the user's overall health / life at the end,
which will be siphoned by the different dark creatures he encounters along the way and restored by items.

Score to me is a less important because I'm envisioning the game more as a story / journey experience than a BEAT THE HIGH SCORE!!! kind of experience.
