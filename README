Project no: 4
Project due date: 4/15/2014
Project description: Object Pooling, Projectiles, Collisions, Explosions, and Sound

The Specs that I implemented are:
*Music
*Collision Detection


The Specs that I was unable to implement are:
*Explosions
*Projectiles / Memory Pooling

Extras:
*Created a new playersprite with run sequences for left and right and an idle sprite.
*fixed old sprites that weren't extracted properly because they were unaligned.
*fixed key captures so they are much more responsive.


ToDo:
*Add in gravity and fix collision detection so player stands on the foreground
	--need to rework background images for this, possibly create new class.  Right now they are just frames instead of Sprites.
*Add health or point system
*Add collectibles
*extend scene and add an ending to the far left

Comments:
*As we've discussed, I don't really see projectiles or explosions really fitting into my game.  That being said, the only thing I did to make up for them is implement new sprites, which isn't really technical so I understand taking off points.  I'm ashamed to admit that this is a poor turnin as I've not completed half the features;  I've just had to reprioritize things lately and this project came out on bottom (also cause for my abysmal quiz performance on Monday).  Hope this isn't disappointing; considering how often I come in and speak with you, I feel like I should be doing a bit better in your class.  I'm still looking forward to creating a well-polished and aesthetically pleasing game, even if it takes into the summer.
